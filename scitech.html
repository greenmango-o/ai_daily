      <div id="card2-content">Over the past 50 years, scientific productivity has declined it now takes more time, money, and effort to make discoveries that once came more 
easily. A key reason is the increasing complexity and specialization of science, which slows down researchers. To address this, FutureHouse, a philanthropically 
funded lab, is building an AI platform to automate key parts of the scientific process. Founded by Sam Rodriques (MIT PhD ’19) and Andrew White, FutureHouse 
developed a suite of AI agents for tasks like literature review, data analysis, and experiment planning. Their goal is to break through research bottlenecks
and boost scientific productivity. Rodriques emphasizes that science is fundamentally driven by natural language, which their AI tools are designed to understand and generate.

 The platform includes agents like:
 
Crow (formerly PaperQA): retrieves and summarizes scientific literature.


Owl (formerly Has Anyone): checks if specific research or experiments have already been done.


Falcon: handles broader literature reviews.


Phoenix: helps design chemistry experiments.


Finch: supports data-driven discovery in biology.


The platform was officially launched in May 2025 and demonstrated its capabilities by identifying a new drug candidate for age-related macular 
degeneration. In June, they also released ether, a powerful open-source reasoning model for chemistry.
Researchers have already used the platform to uncover potential treatments for diseases like polycystic ovary syndrome and Alzheimer’s. 
FutureHouse aims to integrate its AI agents into a seamless system capable of not just reviewing literature but analyzing raw data, verifying results, and forming new hypotheses.
Rodriques envisions a future where these agents are embedded with deeper scientific knowledge and can work with advanced tools and models to further accelerate discovery.
