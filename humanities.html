  Researchers have developed an AI system called Centaur by training a large language model 
  (LLM) on a vast dataset of psychology experiments to mimic human behavior across various 
  tasks. The team published a paper in Nature claiming Centaur can predict and simulate human 
  responses in experiments expressed in natural language, often outperforming specialized 
  cognitive models. For example, in decision-making tasks like the two-armed bandit experiment, 
  Centaur’s outputs aligned more closely with human choices than traditional models. 
  The model also performed well on modified versions of these tasks that it had not seen 
  before, suggesting potential use in designing experiments “in silico.” However, many 
  cognitive scientists remain skeptical of these claims, arguing that Centaur doesn’t 
  genuinely replicate human thought processes. Critics highlight that the model demonstrates 
  superhuman capabilities, such as recalling hundreds of digits and reacting in milliseconds, 
  which are far beyond typical human limits. They warn that Centaur’s mechanisms differ 
  fundamentally from those of the human mind, making it unreliable for generalizing beyond 
  its training data.
<br>
<br>
  Despite these criticisms, some researchers see value in the work, especially the large 
  Psych-101 dataset comprising data from over 160 psychology experiments and 60,000 
  participants. This dataset offers a rich resource for testing and developing future 
  cognitive models. Experts suggest that exploring how Centaur functions internally could 
  provide useful insights, even if it doesn’t yet explain human cognition. Many in the AI 
  and neuroscience communities are cautiously optimistic that, although the paper makes some 
  broad claims, the effort invested may lead to meaningful scientific advances over time.
  Ultimately, Centaur represents a promising early step toward using AI to understand human 
  behavior but requires further refinement and validation.

      <h3>Xbox Producer Suggests AI to staff to Ease job loss pain</h3>
      <img id="xbox" src="images/xbox.webp" alt="pic">
      <p>An Xbox executive faced backlash after recommending that employees impacted by Microsoft’s 
recent layoffs use artificial intelligence to help cope with their emotions—a suggestion he 
made in a now-deleted LinkedIn post. Matt Turnbull, executive producer at Xbox Game Studios 
Publishing, posted this shortly after Microsoft announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs, 
about 4% of its global workforce, with the Xbox division reportedly affected. In his message, 
Turnbull acknowledged the difficulty of layoffs and encouraged those affected to know they 
are not alone, suggesting AI tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot could help ease the 
mental strain of job loss. He shared prompts to assist with tasks such as resume writing, 
LinkedIn updates, and gaining emotional clarity, emphasizing he was trying to offer practical 
support. However, many found the suggestion insensitive, with critics calling it “plain disgusting” 
and “tone-deaf” given the seriousness of layoffs. This controversy arises as Microsoft increases 
its investment in AI, committing $80 billion to build data centers that support its expanding 
AI infrastructure.</p>

      <h3>AI Art Generation And Its effects On Artists</h3>
      <img id="ghibli" src="images/ai_ghibli.webp" alt="Image 2">
      <p>Joy Cardaño, a full-time artist in the Philippines, has seen a sharp decline 
        in commissions for her anime-inspired work as more people turn to AI-generated 
        art. She and many other artists argue that AI threatens their livelihoods by 
        mimicking their styles without consent, stripping value from years of creative 
        effort. Cardaño publicly criticized the use of AI, calling it unethical and 
        urging users to respect artists' rights, especially amid viral trends like 
        Studio Ghibli-inspired AI art. Other artists, like Hollie Mengert and Sarah 
        Andersen, have voiced similar concerns—Mengert found her style being imitated 
        by AI, while Andersen joined a lawsuit against AI companies for copyright 
        infringement. Despite OpenAI's safeguards against replicating the styles of 
        living artists, worries persist, especially as AI tools remain capable of 
        generating images that closely resemble popular aesthetics. While OpenAI CEO 
        Sam Altman defends the technology as a net positive for creativity, many artists 
        feel the financial and emotional impact of AI’s growing role in the art world

      <h3>AI is being adapted by lawyers</h3>
      <img id="law" src="images/ai_law.jpg" alt="Image 3">
      <p>In recent years, legal professionals have become more open to using artificial 
        intelligence (AI), recognizing its ability to improve productivity and transform 
        legal work. According to Thomson Reuters’ 2024 Future of Professionals Report, 
        AI tools are already automating routine tasks like legal research, document review, 
        and contract drafting, saving lawyers up to four hours per week and potentially 
        adding $100,000 in new billable hours annually. To fully benefit, legal 
        professionals must adopt AI thoughtfully and ensure the tools they use are 
        accurate, transparent, and built on trusted legal sources. As workflows become 
        more efficient, many lawyers anticipate a shift away from hourly billing models 
        and toward more value-based services. The time saved by AI could allow lawyers 
        to focus on strategic planning, client relationships, and more meaningful, 
        intellectually rewarding legal work. Ultimately, AI is helping reshape the legal 
        industry, pushing professionals to adapt and deliver greater value to both clients 
        and their firms.

        creation for artists at all levels. CEO Mikey Shulman praised Sinclair’s unique 
        mix of industry and tech experience, calling it essential to the company’s next 
        chapter. Sinclair says he’s excited to explore how AI can empower creativity, 
        support artists, and deepen the connection between music and fans. His appointment 
        comes amid growing debate over AI’s role in music, especially around copyright 
        issues. Suno is currently facing a lawsuit from major record labels, though 
        settlement talks are reportedly in progress.

      <h3> AI is transforming the world of medicine</h3>
      <img id="med" src="images/ai_medicine.webp" alt="Image 3">
      <p>AI is rapidly transforming medicine, shifting from a time-consuming tool for 
        information retrieval into a real-time assistant that can summarize research, 
        support diagnoses, and improve doctor-patient interactions. Tools like 
        OpenEvidence, built on large language models like ChatGPT, are helping doctors 
        make faster, more informed decisions, although concerns remain about biases, 
        hallucinated facts, and the risk of minimal systemic change. Experts argue that 
        AI's success in medicine hinges on addressing inequities, integrating diverse 
        data, and ensuring human oversight to avoid reinforcing flawed legacy systems. 
        In research and education, AI is already enabling major scientific advances and 
        reshaping how future clinicians are trained, from protein structure prediction to 
        virtual patient simulations. While challenges persist, many believe that embracing 
        AI boldly, ethically, and with systemic reform can lead to a more equitable and 
        effective healthcare systems

      <h3>Soul AI Image Generation Stuns Many</h3>
      <img id="ig" src="images/ai_image.webp" alt="Image 3">
      <p>AI image generators have existed for years, but their realism has advanced rapidly 
        in recent months. Tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Firefly, and Midjourney now create 
        visuals that are nearly indistinguishable from real photos, often without visible 
        watermarks. ChatGPT’s release of its 4o image generator brought a wave of attention, 
        but Google’s Gemini, powered by Imagen 4 and Imagen 4 Ultra, offers similarly 
        powerful results. A new player, Soul—developed by Higgsfield—has quickly gone viral 
        for its highly aesthetic, photo-realistic output, often compared to professional 
        smartphone photography. Soul features over 50 built-in presets, such as “iPhone” and 
        “Tokyo Streetstyle,” which make generating specific styles simple and fast, without 
        needing to describe technical details. While it doesn’t support image uploads, a $9 
        monthly subscription gives users 150 credits and watermark-free images, all 
        accessible through a web browser.
